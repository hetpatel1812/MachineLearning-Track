# Types of Machine Learning

Machine Learning is broadly categorized into:

## 1. Supervised Learning
- Learns from labeled data (input and correct output known).
- Types:
  - Regression
  - Classification

## 2. Unsupervised Learning
- Learns from unlabeled data.
- Common tasks: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction

## 3. Reinforcement Learning
- Learns from actions and feedback (rewards/punishments).
- Used in game AI, robotics.

## Comparison Table:

| Type               | Data Type   | Output        | Example                 |
|--------------------|-------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| Supervised         | Labeled     | Predict value | Spam Detection, Prices  |
| Unsupervised       | Unlabeled   | Group/Pattern | Customer Segmentation   |
| Reinforcement      | Feedback    | Action Policy | Game Bot, Self-driving  |
