---

## 🔍 1. Linear Regression (Regression)
- Predicts continuous output using a straight-line fit.
- **Example:** Predicting a person’s salary based on years of experience.

---

## 🔍 2. Logistic Regression (Classification)
- Outputs probability of belonging to a class.
- Uses a sigmoid curve to classify based on threshold.
- **Example:** Classify emails as spam or not spam.

---

## 🔍 3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Instance-based learning.
- Classifies a new sample by **majority vote** of its k nearest neighbors.
- **Example:** Handwriting recognition.

---

## 🔍 4. Decision Tree
- Splits data based on conditions to make decisions.
- Easy to visualize.
- **Example:** Approve/Reject loan applications based on income and credit score.

---

## 🔍 5. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Finds the best hyperplane to separate classes.
- Good with high-dimensional data.
- **Example:** Face recognition/classification.
