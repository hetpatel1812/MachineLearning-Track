# Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of ML where the model learns from a dataset that contains input-output pairs.

## Types of Supervised Learning:
### 1. Regression:
- Output is continuous.
- Example: Predicting house prices

### 2. Classification:
- Output is categorical.
- Example: Email spam detection

## Common Algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
