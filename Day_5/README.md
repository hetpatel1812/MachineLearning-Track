# ðŸ“Š Data Visualization with Python

Welcome to the **Data Visualization with Python** project!  
This repository is a step-by-step journey through a tutorial series on data visualization using Python. It focuses primarily on using the **Matplotlib** library to create powerful and insightful visual representations of data.

This project is ideal for **beginners in data science** or anyone who wants to learn how to visually analyze and communicate data using Python. It also serves as a foundational step for those pursuing **Machine Learning**, since data visualization is a crucial part of the ML workflow for understanding and preparing data.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The aim of this repository is to:
- Learn the fundamentals of data visualization
- Understand how to use Pythonâ€™s `matplotlib` library
- Apply visualization concepts to real-world scenarios
- Build a solid foundation for more advanced visualization tools like Seaborn, Plotly, etc.
- Support data exploration and feature understanding in machine learning
