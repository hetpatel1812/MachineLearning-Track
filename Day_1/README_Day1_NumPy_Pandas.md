# Day 1 – NumPy & Pandas Revision

This folder contains practice notebooks, scripts, or notes related to:
- 📌 **NumPy**: Fast numerical computations in Python, including arrays, broadcasting, vectorized operations, and basic statistics.
- 📌 **Pandas**: Data manipulation with Series and DataFrames, data cleaning, indexing, merging, and aggregation.

## ✅ Learning Objectives
- Understand how to use NumPy arrays instead of Python lists for better performance.
- Perform basic operations like slicing, reshaping, and matrix math with NumPy.
- Load, explore, and manipulate tabular data using Pandas.
- Apply filtering, grouping, and aggregation to real datasets.

## 🛠️ What to Include in This Folder
- Jupyter notebooks or `.py` scripts practicing NumPy and Pandas basics.
- Example datasets (CSV or JSON) you used for hands-on practice.
- Any notes or markdown files summarizing key functions, methods, or tips.

## 🚀 Outcome
This day ensures you have a strong foundation in the two most important libraries for data analysis, preparing you to start learning ML algorithms confidently.
