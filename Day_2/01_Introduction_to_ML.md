# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a field of computer science that enables machines to learn patterns from data and make decisions without being explicitly programmed.

## Why ML?
Traditional programming requires you to define all rules manually. ML automates this by learning from examples.

## Real-World Use Cases:
- Self-driving cars
- Voice assistants (like Alexa, Siri)
- Recommendation systems (Netflix, YouTube)
- Fraud detection
