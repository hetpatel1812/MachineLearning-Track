# 🧠 ML-Task Repository

Welcome to the **ML-Task** repository! This repo is dedicated to documenting my daily journey of learning Machine Learning from the ground up. Each day focuses on a specific topic, concept, or task to build a solid foundation in data science and machine learning.

## 📅 Daily Progress

Each subfolder (Day 1, Day 2, ...) contains:
- 📚 Topic-specific theory notes
- 🧪 Hands-on practice code
- 🧾 Summarized READMEs

| Day | Topics Covered                      |
