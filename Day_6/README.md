# ðŸ“Š Day 6 â€” Matplotlib Overview

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
On **Day 6** of the Machine Learning Track, we explored **Matplotlib**, a powerful Python library for creating a variety of visualizations. The focus was on understanding how to present data clearly and effectively using different types of plots, along with customization techniques for improved readability.

## ðŸ“– Key Learning Points  

### **1. Introduction to Matplotlib**  
- Matplotlib is one of the most widely used Python plotting libraries.  
- We used the `pyplot` module (`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`) to create and manage plots.  

### **2. Line Plots**  
- Show changes or trends in data over time or in a sequence.  
- Learned:
  - Adding **titles**, **axis labels**, and **legends**.  
  - Customizing colors, line styles, markers, and grid lines.  
  - Adjusting axis limits and tick labels.  

### **3. Bar Charts**  
- Compare discrete categories.  
- Learned:
  - Creating vertical bar plots.  
  - Adding colors and legends for clarity.  

### **4. Pie Charts**  
- Show proportions of a whole.  
- Learned:
  - Adding labels and percentage annotations.  
  - Using custom colors for better distinction.  

### **5. Histograms**  
- Display data distribution.  
- Learned:
  - Adjusting the number of bins.  
  - Customizing colors and borders.  

### **6. Scatter Plots**  
- Show relationships between two variables.  
- Learned:
  - Plotting single and multiple datasets.  
  - Using markers, colors, legends, and grid lines.

## ðŸŽ¯ Skills Gained  
- Selecting the right type of visualization for different datasets.  
- Customizing plots to make them professional and clear.  
- Using visualizations for **exploratory data analysis** in machine learning.

## ðŸ“Œ Why This Matters for Machine Learning  
Before building models, visualizing data helps to:  
- Identify patterns and relationships.  
- Detect anomalies or outliers.  
- Communicate insights effectively.
